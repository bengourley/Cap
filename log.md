*August 2011:*
Wrote some basic idealistic syntax, sample programs and prospective grammar.Considered basic syntax changes for first iteration of compiler (simply remove colons etc.), then add syntactic sugar.Research in to JavaScript parser generators: narrowed down to PEG.js (a js implementation of Parsing Expression grammars) or Jison (a js port of Bison).Looking at relevant/similar projects, eg. CoffeeScript, Traceur, Caja.Finding relevant projects for compiler implementation esp. offside rule parsing, e.g Jade, Stylus.*3/10/11*

Met with supervisor.
Progress: Created automated test suite w/ code coverage report. Also found and implemented automated docs tool.Objectives: Amend parser to use invocation by juxtaposition
