*August 2011:*

Wrote some basic idealistic syntax, sample programs and prospective grammar.
Considered basic syntax changes for first iteration of compiler (simply remove colons etc.), then add syntactic sugar.
Research in to JavaScript parser generators: narrowed down to PEG.js (a js implementation of Parsing Expression grammars) or Jison (a js port of Bison).
Looking at relevant/similar projects, eg. CoffeeScript, Traceur, Caja.
Finding relevant projects for compiler implementation esp. offside rule parsing, e.g Jade, Stylus.

*3/10/11*

Met with supervisor.

Progress: presented findings so far, talked about syntax

Objectives: implement parser

*10/10/11*

Met with supervisor.

Progress: basic parser implemented

Objectives: compile some trivial code to js

*17/10/11*

Met with supervisor.

Progress: Compiled some trivial js

Objectives: Create automated test suite for compiler

*24/10/11*

Met with supervisor.

Progress: Created automated test suite w/ code coverage report. Also found and implemented automated docs tool.

Objectives: Amend parser to use invocation by juxtaposition

*31/10/11*

Met with supervisor.

Progress: Amended parser to use invocation by juxtaposition. Big refactor.

Objectives: Finding difficulty avoiding ambiguity in parser generator, write parser by hand.

*07/11/11*

No meeting.

Progress: Foundations of parser written by hand.

Objectives: Add features to parser.

*14/11/11*

No meeting.

Progress: Added features to parser.

Objectives: Write interim report.

*21/11/11*

No meeting.

Progress: Report written and handed in.

Objectives: Away following week â€“ no objectives.


*28/11/11*

Away.

*5/12/11*

No meeting.


--- Christmas break ---


*16/01/12*

Met with supervisor.

Progress: None

Objectives: Complete compiler.


*23/01/12*

No meeting.

Progress: Progress on compiler, but realised add complexity needed.

Objectives: Tests have been lagging, catch up.


*30/01/12*

No meeting.

Progress: Updated tests. Moved to new test framework.

Objectives: Continue progress on compiler, factor out code generation and because a modifier needs to modify the AST
